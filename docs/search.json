We will use GitHub to facilitate this.\n\nIf you do not have a GitHub account, please create one here: https://github.com/\nIf you have a GitHub account, make sure you have a personal access token for HTTPS stored in your local Rstudio. Instructions to do this are provided here: https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat\n\n\n\ntargets\nIn addition to using GitHub, we will also use targets to coordinate our workflow. There will be a brief tutorial for targets during the workshop, but getting familiar with this R package before the workshop is highly encouraged. A full textbook on targets is available: https://books.ropensci.org/targets/.\nReading the following sections prior to the workshop will be very helpful:\n\nIntroduction: https://books.ropensci.org/targets/#intro\nA walk through: https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html\nFunction-based workflow: https://books.ropensci.org/targets/functions.html"

Keep this binary for the sake of using it in causal random forests.\nAge should be named ‘age’ and should be numeric with age in years.\nSex should be named ‘sex’ and should include values of ‘male’ or ‘female’. This does not need to be binary if your data have a large sample (i.e., &gt; 250 observations with &gt;10 dementia events) of people who do not identify in either of those two categories\n\nData sets should have as many predictors of dementia risk possible. Predictors would include any variable that\n\nMay be associated with dementia risk\nMay be associated with APOE4 status\nIs not an effect of dementia or cognitive impairment\nMay explain heterogeneity in the association of APOE4 with dementia risk.\n\nData sets need not have an exhaustive set of predictors, but any predictors must be measured before or at the start of follow-up for the right-censored dementia outcome. Because the analysis will be exploratory and focus on the identifying heterogeneity in the association of APOE4 with incident dementia, we encourage everyone to include as many valid predictors from their data as feasible. A few examples include (but are not limited to):\n\neducation,\nrace/ethnicity,\nsmoking history,\nmid-life htn,\nmid-life obesity,\nhtn drugs and statins,\nSES,\ndiabetes,\nrenal disease,\natrial fibrillation,\ncardiovascular disease,\ndepression,\nhead trauma,\ninsomnia,\northostatic hypotension,\nfamily history of cognitive impairment,\nfamily history of Alzheimer’s Disease"
