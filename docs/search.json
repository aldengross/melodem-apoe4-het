    "text": "Preparation\nPlease join the workshop with a computer that has the following installed (all available for free):\n\nA recent version of R, available at https://cran.r-project.org/\nA recent version of RStudio Desktop (RStudio Desktop Open Source License, at least v2022.02), available at https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/\nA recent version of git, available at https://git-scm.com/downloads\nThe following R packages, which you can install from the R console:\n\n\n# Install the packages for the workshop\npkgs &lt;- \n  c(\"bonsai\", \"doParallel\", \"embed\", \"finetune\", \"lightgbm\", \"lme4\",\n    \"plumber\", \"probably\", \"ranger\", \"rpart\", \"rpart.plot\", \"rules\",\n    \"splines2\", \"stacks\", \"text2vec\", \"textrecipes\", \"tidymodels\", \n    \"vetiver\", \"remotes\")\n\ninstall.packages(pkgs)\n\nIf you’re a Windows user and encounter an error message during installation noting a missing Rtools installation, install Rtools using the installer linked here.\n\nGitHub\nA major aim of the workshop will be to establish a baseline of collaboration for developing and publishing a manuscript. We will use GitHub to facilitate this.\n\nIf you do not have a GitHub account, please create one here: https://github.com/\nIf you have a GitHub account, make sure you have a personal access token for HTTPS stored in your local Rstudio. Instructions to do this are provided here: https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat\n\n\n\ntargets\nIn addition to using GitHub, we will also use targets to coordinate our workflow. There will be a brief tutorial for targets during the workshop, but getting familiar with this R package before the workshop is highly encouraged. A full textbook on targets is available: https://books.ropensci.org/targets/.\nReading the following sections prior to the workshop will be very helpful:\n\nIntroduction: https://books.ropensci.org/targets/#intro\nA walk through: https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html\nFunction-based workflow: https://books.ropensci.org/targets/functions.html"
