## Welcome

These are the materials for the MEthods in LOngitudinal DEMentia ([MELODEM](http://www.melodem.org/)) workshops offered at Ch√¢teau de Bellinglise, France, July 2024. 

The workshop focuses on the use of random forests to predict dementia risk and identify heterogeneity in the association between APOE4 and dementia risk. This website hosts the materials for the workshop and the corresponding GitHub repository (todo: add link here) includes additional materials for manuscript development.

## Preparation

Please join the workshop with a computer that has the following installed (all available for free):

-   A recent version of R, available at <https://cran.r-project.org/>
-   A recent version of RStudio Desktop (RStudio Desktop Open Source License, at least v2022.02), available at <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>
-   A recent version of git, available at <https://git-scm.com/downloads>
-   The following R packages, which you can install from the R console:

```{r}
#| label: installs
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

# Install the packages for the workshop
pkgs <- 
  c("bonsai", "doParallel", "embed", "finetune", "lightgbm", "lme4",
    "plumber", "probably", "ranger", "rpart", "rpart.plot", "rules",
    "splines2", "stacks", "text2vec", "textrecipes", "tidymodels", 
    "vetiver", "remotes")

install.packages(pkgs)
```

If you're a Windows user and encounter an error message during installation noting a missing Rtools installation, install Rtools using the installer linked [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

### GitHub

A major aim of the workshop will be to establish a baseline of collaboration for developing and publishing a manuscript. We will use GitHub to facilitate this. 

-    If you do not have a GitHub account, please create one here: <https://github.com/>
-    If you have a GitHub account, make sure you have a personal access token for HTTPS stored in your local Rstudio. Instructions to do this are provided here: <https://happygitwithr.com/https-pat>

### `targets`

In addition to using GitHub, we will also use `targets` to coordinate our workflow. There will be a brief tutorial for `targets` during the workshop, but getting familiar with this R package before the workshop is *highly encouraged*. A full textbook on `targets` is available: <https://books.ropensci.org/targets/>. 

Reading the following sections prior to the workshop will be very helpful:

1. Introduction: <https://books.ropensci.org/targets/#intro>
2. A walk through: <https://books.ropensci.org/targets/walkthrough.html>
3. Function-based workflow: <https://books.ropensci.org/targets/functions.html>

## Slides

These slides are designed to use with live teaching and are published for workshop participants' convenience. They are not meant as standalone learning materials.

## Acknowledgments {.appendix}

This website, including the slides, is made with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and is based on the fantastic [workshops](https://workshops.tidymodels.org/) developed by the [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) team. Please submit an issue (todo: add link to github repo) on the GitHub repo for this workshop if you find something that could be fixed or improved.
